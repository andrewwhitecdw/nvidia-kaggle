"""Append-only local log of Kaggle submission attempts.

``submit_kernel.py`` appends one JSON line per submission attempt and per
finished evaluation to ``data/submissions.jsonl`` under the project root.
The log survives crashed runs and lost terminal output, so a workflow can
check what a previous run already submitted BEFORE spending another daily
submission slot. ``submission_history.py`` renders it.
